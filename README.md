# KML 3D Viewer (PWA)

Client-only PWA that loads a `.kml` file and renders it on a 3D globe (CesiumJS). Includes a Google-Earth-like “Places” folder tree with toggles.

## Run locally

```powershell
python -m http.server 5190 --directory .\kml-3d-pwa
```

Open: `http://localhost:5190/`

## Notes

- Uses CesiumJS from CDN.
- No Cesium ion token required: it uses OpenStreetMap imagery and ellipsoid terrain by default.
- Intended for the KML output generated by the Results Archive tool (nested folders: Participant → Location Source → Building).

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (index.html at repo root)

1. Create a new GitHub repo and put these files at the repo root:
	- `index.html`, `app.js`, `styles.css`, `service-worker.js`, `manifest.json`, `.nojekyll`
	- `icons/` folder
	- `.github/workflows/pages.yml`
2. Push to `main`.
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment**
	- Source: **GitHub Actions**
4. After the workflow finishes, your site will be available at:
	- `https://<org-or-user>.github.io/<repo>/`

### Updating

This app uses a "no-cache" service worker (it does not cache or serve cached assets). When you change code, just bump the cache-bust versions in `index.html` (e.g. `app.js?v=…`) so browsers fetch the latest file.
